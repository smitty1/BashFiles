On startup press " C " at the grub screen.
At the grub> prompt type videoinfo, ( it may be vbeinfo on some machines)
Write  down one of the  listed available resolutions. Anything between 640x480x32 up to 1024x768x32 work well on my Yoga 720.
Press esc to get back to the grub screen.
Boot into the distribution that has control of the grub. In my case it is the Manjaro.
As root edit /etc/default/grub
Enter the resolution you chose above for the value of the GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX key
run sudo update-grub and then reboot.
 Some distributions do not have the update-grub shortcut, in that case run the full command:
 	sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
